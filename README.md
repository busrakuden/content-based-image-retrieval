# Content Based Image Retrieval
By evaluating the color and texture similarities of the pictures, a system was created to find the 5 most similar pictures to a picture.

Only the color and texture similarities are calculated with the Manhattan City Block (L1 norm) method, and the 5 most similar images to the entered image are found.

The output of the program is given in the figure below.
